# Learn Scrapy

My notes on learning Scrapy ðŸ•·.

This is not an exhausting resource for the public to learn.
Use [official Scrapy tutorial][scrapy-tutorial] instead.

Use the [guide](docs/guide.md) as a starting point.

This project contains the scrapers below:

- [basic](src/basic): The simplest working example of Scrapy scraper.
- [quotes](src/quotes): A scraper for [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com).
